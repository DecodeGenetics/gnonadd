## Revision from first submission

We got some comments from Beni Altmann, they have been addressed in the following manner:

1) Added single quotes in Description field and removed linebreaks.
2) Added reference to one article in the description field.
3) Made authors as contributors with ctb and added deCODE/Amgen as cph and fnd.
4) Replaced all occurrences T and F with TRUE and FALSE.

Hope this covers all issues, thanks for reviewing the package!
