Description: The goal of 'gnonadd' is to simplify workflows in the analysis of non-additive effects of sequence variants. This includes variance effects (Ivarsdottir et. al (2017) <doi:https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.3928>), correlation effects, interaction effects and dominance effects. The package also includes convenience functions for visualization.
